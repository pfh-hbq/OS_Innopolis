Program 1 output {
	Hello
	Hello
}

Program 2 output {
	Hello


}

Difference appears because of programms write "Hello" to buffer and symbols "\n" clear the buffer.
In the first programm code forks program with "Hello" in buffer, and in the second programm forks without it (because it was cleared by "\n").
